What is ShapeNet?
-official tensorflow implementation provides a subset of shapeNet
-

What is /meta after shapeNet?
What is /shapenet after preprocess?

Where is imageNet in this project?


What is slurm clusters?
-train on slurm clusters?????????


what is yml?
-modify configuration in a yml file for training/evaluation
it overrides default settings in options.py

meta files to help you to establish the folder tree?

whati is .pth file?
A PTH file is a machine learning model created using PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library.


Dataset Class is a wrapper: loads the data from a given file path and returns a dictionary containing already prepared data.
__len__(self)  返回整个dataset的文件多少
__getitem__(self, index)返回第i个文件（已经经过transform，具体transform方法可以构造类时导入）

Transform class:  处理图片
__call__(self, image)  可以用transform()方便的调用

DataLoader Class:




talking to the moon~ 
try to get to you~
in case you're on the other side 
talking to me too
or i'm a fool 
who speaks alone 
talking to the moon~

i know you're somewhere out there 
somewhere far away 
i want you back
i want you back

my neighbours think i am crazy 
they don't understand 
you're all i had
you're all i had

at night when the stars light up my room 
i sit by myself
talking to the moon~
try to get to you~
